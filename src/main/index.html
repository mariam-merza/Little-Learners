            <p>Hi, my name is Reem Maqadsy. I am a licensed home daycare owner
                located in Whitby, Ontario. I have 15 years of experience working with children and running a daycare
                from home. I am fully licensed with Bright Minds and first-aid certified. In a world that is rapidly changing everyday, I aim to create a safe and enjoyable space
                for children to learn and grow. I do educational games, creative play, and various arts and crafts.
                My backyard is fully fenced and we go outside to play on a daily basis, or depending on the weather.
                I provide healthy, homemade meals and snacks. <strong>My daycare is a home away from home for your
                little one.</strong>
